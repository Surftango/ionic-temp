# AXA Android Binding for Xamarin 


This folder contains following files which are necessary to instrument the Xamarin Android application

— AXAAndroidBindings.dll
— CAMobileAppAnalytics-wrapper.zip


#  AXAAndroidBindings.dll

This binding dll file contains all the integration APIs which we are going to support. Below are the steps to use the DLL.

1. Place the DLL in the Xamarin Android project.

2. Add AXAAndroidBindings.DLL to the project by double clicking on the Reference folder and select the file path of the AXAAndroidBindings.DLL

3. Use the below mentioned namespace to start using the APIs.

using Com.CA.Integration; 

4. Call the necessary APIs. 
  
example:

 CaMDOIntegration.LogNetworkEvent("http://exampleurl.com”,20,20,30,40);



# CAMobileAppAnalytics-wrapper.zip

This is the wrapper which needs to be used to wrap the apk file which is generated by Xamarin. 



Note: Currently the HTTP calls are not captured by the wrapper. For now app developer needs to use our API LogNetworkEvent() where network requests are made.
